        <h1>Our Story</h1>
    
        <p> In 2010 Co-Founders Sara and Rowan rushed to Devon having been told that Sara’s mother - known to the family as
            ‘Wellie’ - was having life-saving brain surgery. Whilst she unexpectedly survived her stroke she required
            24-hour
            care and moved into the family home, joining her husband and Sara’s father - from whom she had been separated
            for
            over two decades.</p>
    
        <p> It quickly became evident that the home care sector was archaic and desperately in
            need of change; every attempt Sara made to ensure her parents were cared for in an anxiety-free manner was met
            with
            difficulties, inefficient processes and constraints.</p>
    
        <p> She found that two carers from each of three different agencies were well-matched to ‘Wellie’ and ‘Gramps’, but
            no way existed for these carers to work together
            in the required 6-person team. Whichever agency she chose, she knew two thirds of the carers would not be
            suitable.</p>
    
        <p> Rather than settle for this, she convinced these 6 individuals to register with a new
            agency, which agreed to allocate them entirely to her parents and allowed her to manage the care package. Her
            mother
            went on to regain 80% of the functionality her doctors said she would never regain.</p>
    
        <p> This inspired Rowan to leave his job in the City to assemble a team of healthcare professionals, engineers and
            entrepreneurs so
            that he could build a platform which offers personalised care to everyone.</p>
    
        <p> Our mission is to make it easy for people to make their own care choices and access the most trusted home care
            in the world. To join us on our
            journey, get started today!</p>

                    Rowan watched his grandparents receive home care for years. After a year in the City he left his job to build a care system that cares for all elderly people with the compassion they deserve. In his spare time he volunteers for South London Cares.

                    Neil went from living with a huge family in India, to a relative living alone in London. Having someone around who cares made a massive difference to her mood. He wants everyone to have such companionship. He has previously developed software for Google, Microsoft and Morgan Stanley.

                    Having spent 35 years in various healthcare roles, Sara has an unparalleled appreciation for standards. After continuously witnessing those without a voice receive sub-standard care she vowed to make it easy to find quality. In her spare time she likes to fight other people&#x27;s battles for them.
